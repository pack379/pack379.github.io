## Arrival Information

SPECIAL NOTE: Please hold up or put a paper sign on your drivers side window saying
"CS DISTRICT 29".  This will allow staff to direct you to the right area.

ALL vehicles are to enter at the speedway’s main entrance on Labonte Lane, off Highway 114.
(Carpooling is strongly encouraged to reduce traffic congestion.) Drivers will be directed to the
appropriate parking area, from which passengers are to depart and walk to their campsites.
Equipment vehicles can be taken to campsites but should be moved to the parking lot after
unloading. One trailer can remain at the campsite.

## Packing List

SPECIAL NOTE: Bring two water bottles.

Review the [packing list](/forms/packinglist/).  Pack only the very minimum 
that you will need.  If you are able to carry your camping supplies in a 
rolling wagon or on you, then you may find this more conveniant than trying 
to get in and out of TMS with your vehicle to drop off gear.  No vehicles 
can remain in the campsite during 
the day.

## Facilities

We will only use propane or liquid fuel stoves, and simple backcountry 
type meal prep (one pot, easy grilling, no mess, etc) to minimize cleanup 
time and food mess.

Water will be available, but not conveniantly accessible.  This is the 
reason for bringing two water bottles, to reduce your trips to fill up 
with water.

We will be required to bring trash bags home.

The site will be mostly portapotties, with a very small number of flush 
toilets and showers available.

## First Aid

All injuries must be reported to Cameron King or the Headquarters First Aid 
station.
