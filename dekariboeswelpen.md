We are sister-units with the [Caribou Cubs](https://caenepeelfauve.wixsite.com/dekariboeswelpen).  Their unit ([218e FOS De Kariboes](https://dekariboes.be/) \[[facebook](https://fb.me/dekariboes/)]) are members of [FOS Open Scouting in Belgium](https://fosopenscouting.be).  Our leaders met at the [24th World Scout Jamboree](https://www.2019wsj.org/), and both units were founded around the same time in 2019.

We look forward to meeting our new friends and learning about Scouting in other countries!
