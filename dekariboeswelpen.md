We are sister-units with the [Caribou Cubs](https://caenepeelfauve.wixsite.com/dekariboeswelpen).

[218e FOS De Kariboes](https://dekariboes.be/) \[[facebook](https://fb.me/dekariboes/)] is a member of [FOS Open Scouting in Belgium](https://fosopenscouting.be).  Our leaders met at the [24th World Scout Jamboree](https://www.2019wsj.org/), and both units were founded around the same time in 2019.  We will be sending little things back and forth, starting with our upcoming Christmas parties.

We look forward to meeting our new friends and learning about Scouting in other countries!
