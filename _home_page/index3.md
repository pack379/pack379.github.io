title: Family Scouting
---
Our pack is a "family scouting" pack.  This means that both boys and girls are invited to join our program.  Cub Scouts are organized into dens, grouped by age and gender.  All of the dens then come together for pack meetings and activities.

Campouts and acitivities are family events and open to visitors who might be interested in joining scouting.  Bring mom, dad, uncle Joe, your long lost cousin, and the neighbor boy who always shows up at dinnertime.  We would love to meet them!
